# UI Components

The Spice86 UI consists of several interconnected components that work together to provide a comprehensive debugging and emulation experience.

## Main Components Requirements

### Main Window

The primary application window must:
- Display the emulation output
- Provide a menu system for accessing features
- Show status indicators for emulation state
- Provide access to debugging tools

### Debug Window

The specialized debugging window must:
- Contain disassembly views (Classic and Modern)
- Provide a memory viewer
- Display CPU state
- Allow breakpoint management
- Include stepping controls

### Modern Disassembly View

The enhanced disassembly view must:
- Implement syntax highlighting for assembly code
- Highlight the current instruction being executed
- Allow navigation to specific functions
- Display assembly code with proper formatting

### Classic Disassembly View

The traditional disassembly view must:
- Provide a simple text-based display of disassembled code
- Support basic navigation through the code

### Memory View

The memory view component must:
- Display the contents of emulated memory in hexadecimal format
- Show ASCII representation of memory contents
- Include navigation controls for moving through memory
- Allow editing of memory values

### CPU State View

The CPU state view must:
- Display all register values
- Show flag states
- Indicate the current instruction
- Update in real-time during debugging

## Component Interactions

The components must interact according to these requirements:

1. **Coordinated Updates**: When the emulator state changes, all relevant components must update accordingly
   - CPU state changes must be reflected in the CPU State View
   - Memory changes must be reflected in the Memory View
   - Instruction pointer changes must be reflected in the Disassembly Views

2. **Consistent State**: All components must maintain a consistent view of the emulator state
   - The same memory address must show the same value in all views
   - The current instruction must be consistently highlighted across views

3. **Independent Operation**: Components must be able to function independently when needed
   - The Memory View must work even if the Disassembly View is not visible
   - The CPU State View must update even if other views are not active

## Performance Requirements

1. **Lazy Loading**: Components must only be loaded when needed
   - The Debug Window must only be created when debugging is requested
   - The Modern Disassembly View must only be created when its tab is selected

2. **Efficient Updates**: Components must implement efficient update strategies
   - Only changed values should trigger UI updates
   - Large collections should use virtualization
   - Updates should be batched when possible

3. **Responsive UI**: The UI must remain responsive during emulation
   - Long-running operations must not block the UI thread
   - Components must use asynchronous operations where appropriate

## Extensibility Requirements

1. **Pluggable Architecture**: The component system must support adding new components
   - New views must be able to integrate with existing components
   - The component system must use interfaces for communication

2. **Customizable Views**: Components must support customization
   - Users must be able to adjust display settings
   - Layout should be configurable where appropriate

## Constraints

1. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: All components must work across supported platforms
   - Must use Avalonia UI controls
   - Must avoid platform-specific code

2. **Memory Efficiency**: Components must be memory-efficient
   - Must release resources when not in use
   - Must use virtualization for large datasets

3. **Accessibility**: Components must be accessible
   - Must support keyboard navigation
   - Must use standard UI patterns
