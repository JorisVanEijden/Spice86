# Performance Requirements

The Spice86 UI must implement several performance optimizations to ensure responsive operation even when dealing with complex debugging tasks.

## Lazy Loading Requirements

1. **Component Creation**:
   - Components must only be created when needed
   - The Debug Window must only be created when debugging is requested
   - The Modern Disassembly View must only be created when its tab is selected
   - ViewModels must only be instantiated when their corresponding views are activated

2. **Resource Management**:
   - Required parameters must be stored for later use
   - Resources must be released when no longer needed
   - Memory usage must be minimized for inactive components

## UI Update Requirements

1. **Targeted Updates**:
   - Only specific items that need refreshing must be updated
   - Full collection refreshes must be avoided when possible
   - Changes must be tracked to avoid unnecessary updates

2. **UI Thread Management**:
   - UI operations must be performed on the UI thread
   - Heavy operations must run in background threads
   - The UI must remain responsive during long-running operations

3. **Efficient Collection Handling**:
   - Large collections must use virtualization
   - Collection updates must be batched when possible
   - Appropriate data structures must be used for different scenarios

## Memory Efficiency Requirements

1. **Resource Disposal**:
   - Disposable resources must be properly disposed
   - Unused resources must be released in a timely manner
   - Memory leaks must be prevented

2. **Data Structure Optimization**:
   - Appropriate data structures must be used for different scenarios
   - Memory-intensive operations must be optimized
   - Large datasets must be managed efficiently

3. **Virtualization**:
   - UI controls displaying large datasets must use virtualization
   - Only visible items must be rendered
   - Off-screen items must be recycled

## CPU Usage Requirements

1. **Background Processing**:
   - CPU-intensive operations must run in background threads
   - The UI thread must not be blocked by long-running operations
   - Work must be distributed across multiple threads when appropriate

2. **Throttling and Debouncing**:
   - Frequent updates must be throttled
   - Rapid user inputs must be debounced
   - Continuous operations must be optimized

3. **Efficient Algorithms**:
   - Algorithms must be optimized for performance
   - Time complexity must be considered for operations on large datasets
   - Caching must be used for expensive computations

## Startup Performance Requirements

1. **Fast Application Startup**:
   - Initial loading time must be minimized
   - Only essential components must be loaded at startup
   - Non-essential initialization must be deferred

2. **Progressive Loading**:
   - The UI must become interactive as soon as possible
   - Additional features must load progressively
   - The user must be able to start working before all components are loaded

## Measurement and Monitoring

1. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Key performance indicators must be defined
   - Performance must be measurable
   - Performance regressions must be detectable

2. **Profiling**:
   - Performance bottlenecks must be identifiable
   - Memory usage must be monitorable
   - CPU usage must be trackable
