# Debug Window

The Debug Window is a key component of Spice86's debugging capabilities, providing tools for reverse engineering and debugging DOS programs.

## Overview

The Debug Window must provide:
- A comprehensive interface for debugging DOS programs
- Multiple views for different aspects of the emulator state
- Controls for managing the debugging process

## Key Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Disassembly Viewing**:
   - Must provide both Classic and Modern disassembly views
   - Must allow switching between views via tabs
   - Must highlight the current instruction being executed

2. **Memory Inspection**:
   - Must display memory contents in hexadecimal and ASCII formats
   - Must allow navigation to specific memory addresses
   - Must support editing memory values

3. **CPU State Monitoring**:
   - Must display all CPU registers and flags
   - Must update in real-time during debugging
   - Must highlight changes to register values

4. **Breakpoint Management**:
   - Must allow setting, editing, and clearing breakpoints
   - Must support different types of breakpoints (execution, memory read/write)
   - Must provide a list of active breakpoints

5. **Execution Control**:
   - Must provide controls for pausing, resuming, and stepping through code
   - Must support step-into, step-over, and run-to-cursor operations
   - Must allow setting the instruction pointer

### Performance Requirements

1. **Lazy Loading**:
   - The Debug Window must only be created when debugging is requested
   - Components within the Debug Window must only be loaded when needed
   - Resources must be released when no longer needed

2. **Responsive UI**:
   - The UI must remain responsive during debugging operations
   - Long-running operations must not block the UI thread
   - Updates must be efficient and targeted

### Usability Requirements

1. **Intuitive Interface**:
   - Controls must be logically organized
   - Common operations must be easily accessible
   - Navigation between different views must be straightforward

2. **Informative Feedback**:
   - Must provide clear indication of the current debugging state
   - Must show relevant information about the current instruction
   - Must highlight important changes in the emulator state

## Constraints

1. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**:
   - Must work across all supported platforms
   - Must use Avalonia UI controls
   - Must avoid platform-specific code

2. **Resource Efficiency**:
   - Must minimize memory usage
   - Must use virtualization for large datasets
   - Must implement efficient update strategies

3. **Integration with Emulator Core**:
   - Must maintain synchronization with the emulator state
   - Must not interfere with emulator performance
   - Must handle emulator events appropriately
