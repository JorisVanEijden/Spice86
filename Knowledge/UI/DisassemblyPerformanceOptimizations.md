# Disassembly Performance Optimizations

## Overview

This document describes the performance optimizations implemented in the ModernDisassemblyViewModel to ensure efficient handling of large disassembly listings.

## Batch Update Mechanism

### Requirement

When updating the disassembly view with a large number of instructions (approximately 800 items), we need to avoid triggering multiple collection change notifications, which can cause performance issues in the UI.

## Sorted View for UI Display

### Requirement

The UI requires a sorted collection of debugger lines for display, while the backend needs fast lookups by address.

## Fast Lookups

### Requirement

The disassembly view needs to quickly find a specific instruction by its address, especially during scrolling operations.
