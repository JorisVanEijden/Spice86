# UI Architecture

The Spice86 UI architecture is designed to ensure maintainability, testability, and performance.

## Technology Stack Requirements

- **UI Framework**: Must use Avalonia - a cross-platform .NET UI framework
- **Language**: Must use C#
- **Pattern**: Must follow MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern
- **Project Location**: Must be located in `src\Spice86\Spice86.csproj`

## Design Pattern Requirements

### MVVM Pattern

The UI must strictly follow the MVVM pattern:

1. **Models**: Must represent the data and business logic
   - Must include CPU state, memory contents, etc.

2. **ViewModels**: Must transform model data for views and handle user interactions
   - Must implement properties, commands, and events for the views
   - Must handle business logic and data transformation

3. **Views**: Must define the UI structure and appearance
   - Must bind to ViewModel properties and commands
   - Must not contain business logic

### Interface-Based Decoupling

The UI must implement interface-based decoupling:

1. **Interfaces**: Must define contracts between components
   - Must specify required properties, methods, and events

2. **Concrete Implementations**: Must implement the interfaces
   - Must fulfill all requirements specified in the interfaces

3. **Adapters**: Must bridge between interfaces and implementations when needed
   - Must facilitate communication between components with different interfaces

### Dependency Injection

The UI must use dependency injection:

1. **Service Registration**: Must register services with appropriate lifetimes
   - Must include singleton services for shared resources
   - Must include transient services for per-request resources

2. **Constructor Injection**: Must use constructor injection for dependencies
   - Must clearly indicate required dependencies
   - Must support optional dependencies where appropriate

3. **Service Resolution**: Must resolve services at runtime
   - Must handle resolution failures gracefully

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Thread Safety

The UI must ensure thread safety:

1. **UI Thread**: Must perform all UI operations on the UI thread
   - Must use Dispatcher.UIThread for UI updates from background threads

2. **Background Operations**: Must perform long-running operations in background threads
   - Must not block the UI thread with CPU-intensive tasks

### Performance

The UI must prioritize performance:

1. **Lazy Loading**: Must only instantiate components when needed
   - Must defer creation of expensive resources until required

2. **Efficient Updates**: Must minimize UI updates
   - Must use targeted updates rather than refreshing entire collections

3. **Resource Management**: Must properly manage resources
   - Must dispose of resources when no longer needed

### Error Handling

The UI must implement robust error handling:

1. **User Feedback**: Must provide meaningful error messages to users
   - Must avoid technical details in user-facing messages

2. **Logging**: Must log errors for debugging
   - Must include sufficient context for troubleshooting

3. **Recovery**: Must attempt to recover from errors when possible
   - Must maintain application stability

## Constraints

1. Must work across multiple platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux)
2. Must maintain compatibility with the emulator core
3. Must support both debugging and normal operation modes
4. Must be extensible for future enhancements
