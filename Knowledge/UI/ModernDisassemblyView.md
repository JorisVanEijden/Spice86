# Modern Disassembly View

The Modern Disassembly View is a component of the Spice86 debugger that provides an enhanced interface for viewing disassembled code.

## Overview

The Modern Disassembly View is designed to provide a clear and efficient way to view and navigate disassembled code.

## Key Requirements

- **Instruction Highlighting**: Must highlight the current instruction based on CPU state
- **Function Navigation**: Must allow navigation to specific functions in the disassembled code
- **Lazy Loading**: Must only be instantiated when the Modern View tab is selected
- **Centered Scrolling**: Must keep the current instruction within the middle 50% of the visible area
- **Thread-Safe UI Updates**: Must ensure all UI operations are performed on the UI thread

## Functional Requirements

### Instruction Highlighting

The view must highlight the current instruction being executed:

1. The current instruction must be visually distinct from other instructions
2. The highlighting must update when the CPU state changes
3. The highlighting must be accurate and reflect the actual instruction being executed
4. The highlighting must update when stepping through code or when breakpoints are hit

### Scrolling Behavior

The view must implement an enhanced scrolling behavior:

1. The current instruction must always be visible when debugging
2. The current instruction should be positioned in the middle portion of the screen when possible
3. Scrolling must be smooth and not disorienting to the user
4. The view must automatically scroll to the current instruction when the CPU pauses

### Property Model

The view model must maintain a clear state model:

1. It must track the current instruction address
2. It must update this address only when appropriate (when the emulator pauses)
3. It must use this address for highlighting and scrolling

### Thread Safety

The implementation must ensure thread safety:

1. All UI operations must be performed on the UI thread
2. Background operations must not cause UI freezes or exceptions
3. The system must handle concurrent access to shared resources

### Stepping Through Code

The stepping functionality must:

1. Allow stepping into the next instruction
2. Allow stepping over the current instruction when appropriate
3. Update the UI to reflect the new state after stepping
4. Maintain proper highlighting of the current instruction

### View-ViewModel Decoupling

The architecture must follow proper decoupling:

1. The view must depend only on the interface, not the concrete implementation
2. The interface must define a clear contract between view and view model
3. The implementation must be replaceable without changing the view

## Performance Requirements

1. The view must respond quickly to user interactions
2. The view must only update elements that have changed
3. The view must load quickly when the tab is selected
4. The view must handle large disassembly listings efficiently

## Testing Requirements

The Modern Disassembly View must be tested thoroughly:

1. Unit tests must verify the core functionality
2. Tests must cover edge cases and error conditions
3. Performance tests must ensure the view remains responsive
4. Integration tests must verify correct interaction with other components

## Constraints

1. Must work within the Avalonia UI framework
2. Must be compatible with the existing emulator architecture
3. Must maintain separation of concerns between UI and emulation logic
4. Must be maintainable and extensible for future enhancements
