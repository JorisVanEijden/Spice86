- When building C# code to see if it compiles, only build the affected project, not the whole solution.
- that the build succeeds does not mean the implementation is correct.

* Workflow
Follow this sequence of events:
1. Analyze
2. Design
3. Implement
4. Build
5. Test
6. Get confirmation from human tester
7. Update documentation if needed

* Documentation
- The root of the project contains an Obsidian vault named "Knowledge". 
- When a new requirement has been implemented, add it to the documentation.
- Document only functional requirements, do not document implementation details.
- Do not document benefits or non-functional requirements.
- The documentation is mainly there for AIs to understand the goals and requirements. Not to keep a history of changes.

* Feedback
- Ask for a decision when there is a choice of actions to take.
- Ask for clarification if there is any ambiguity about the expected behavior.
- Ask specific questions if the context of a task is unclear.
